After weeks of hard work, I’m excited to finally share my developer portfolio with the world! My goal was to create a clean, functional, and professional site that not only highlights my skills and projects but also offers a simple, user-friendly experience. In this post, I’ll walk you through the main features of the site and share a few key lessons I learned along the way.

## Key Features

### 1. Minimalistic UI with Shadcn UI Library

I used [**Shadcn UI**](https://ui.shadcn.com/) to build clean, minimal UI components that keep the design simple and to the point, without distracting from the content.

### 2. Mobile-friendly UI and Theme Toggle

The website is responsive and you can easily switch between **light mode** and **dark mode**, making the site comfortable to view in any environment, especially mobile.

### 3. Straight-to-the-Point Homepage

The homepage is designed to be no-nonsense—**my resume, projects, and contact links** are all there upfront, so visitors get the essentials right away.

### 4. Blog (Infrequently Updated)

I’ve also added a blog, where I’ll occasionally share my thoughts and updates as I work on new projects or features.

### 5. Contact Page with Email Integration

The [**Contact**](/contact) page lets visitors send me a message directly, which I receive as an email for easy communication.

### 6. nilanjana's AI Avatar: Your Interactive Guide

One of the coolest features is the **AI chatbot**, which is trained on the content from my portfolio and can answer simple questions about my work and background. _Please do not bully it!_


Thanks for checking out my portfolio! I’m excited to keep improving it and learning from the process. Feel free to explore and reach out if you have any questions.
